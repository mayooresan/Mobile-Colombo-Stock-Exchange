This is a small JQuery Mobile project which reads the open XML webservice from Colombo Stock Exchange

To come out of Cross Domain issue I've used a PHP proxy I found online.

You can check out the live site at http://cse.mayuonline.com/CSE.html 

As you can see currently site is very heavy and not very much suitable for Mobiles. I'll have to work on optimizing it.

Reading XML made easy by JQuery's XPATH.
